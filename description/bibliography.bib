However, there is little empirical evidence of the acceptance of MDE in industry which is the subject of this paper. The goal of this empirical study was to investigate the state of the practice of applying MDE and factors considered as important for its adoption. The subjects were developers of four large companies participating in a research project. The collected data came from multiple sources and covered the results of tool evaluations, interviews, and a survey. Among the factors, we found perceived usefulness, ease of use and the maturity of the tools to be important determinants for the adoption of MDE. We also discuss challenges with adopting MDE and present suggestions on how to succeed with the adoption process.},

Some of these features are initiated explicitly by domain engineers (batch execution) while others are executed automatically when certain trigger events are detected (live execution). Unfortunately, their integration into a complex industrial modeling environment is difficult due to hidden interference and unspecified interaction between different features. In this paper, we present a reactive, event-driven model transformation platform over EMF models, which captures tool features as model queries and transformations, and provides a systematic, well-founded integration between a variety of such tool features. Viatra 3 offers a family of internal DSLs (i.e. dedicated libraries) to specify advanced tool features built on top of existing languages like EMF-IncQuery and Xtend. Its main innovation is a source incremental execution scheme built on the reactive programming paradigm ssupported by an event-driven virtual machine.},

While they permit tackling advanced scenarios, some applications deal with models that are only available as a possibly infinite stream of elements. Hence, in streaming transformations, source model elements are continuously produced by some process, or very large models are fragmented and fed into the transformation engine. This poses a series of issues that cannot be tackled using current transformation engines. In this paper we motivate the applicability of this kind of transformations, explore the elements involved, and review several strategies to deal with them. We also propose a concrete approach, built on top of the Eclectic transformation tool.},

	abstract = {Streaming model transformations represent a novel class of transformations dealing with models whose elements are continuously produced or modified by a background process [1]. Executing streaming transformations requires efficient techniques to recognize the activated transformation rules on a potentially infinite input stream. Detecting a series of events triggered by compound structural changes is especially challenging for a high volume of rapid modifications, a characteristic of an emerging class of applications built on runtime models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for streaming model transformations by combining incremental model query techniques with complex event processing (CEP) and reactive (event-driven) transformations. The event stream is automatically populated from elementary model changes by the incremental query engine, and the CEP engine is used to identify complex event combinations, which are used to trigger the execution of transformation rules. We demonstrate our approach in the context of automated gesture recognition over live models populated by Kinect sensor data.},
